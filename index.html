      <h3 class="l2">Custom Clearance (Import and Export)</h3>
      <p class="container">
        Customs clearance is the process by which national governments control
        and monetize the flow of goods across international borders. To define
        clearance in the context of customs control, it’s enough to say that any
        goods you ship internationally must receive permission to move across an
        international border. This “clearance” can only be granted by the
        customs authority in the country concerned. To move out of the country
        of origin, your shipments must receive export clearance, and they must
        be granted import clearance to enter the destination country. Import and
        export customs clearance procedures must be one of the most daunting
        elements of international freight shipping for small to medium-sized
        enterprises, especially those taking first steps into the global
        business arena. Of course, a freight forwarder like GAJ can shoulder a
        lot of the complexity of clearing goods through customs and spare you
        from micromanaging the customs clearance process yourself. However,
        everything will seem less complicated if you choose GAJ for your
        service.
