      <div class="container">
        <img class="page-img" src="img/Picture5.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Customs clearance is the process by which national governments control
          and monetize the flow of goods across international borders. To define
          clearance in the context of customs control, it’s enough to say that
          any goods you ship internationally must receive permission to move
          across an international border. This “clearance” can only be granted
          by the customs authority in the country concerned. To move out of the
          country of origin, your shipments must receive export clearance, and
          they must be granted import clearance to enter the destination
          country. Import and export customs clearance procedures must be one of
          the most daunting elements of international freight shipping for small
          to medium-sized enterprises, especially those taking first steps into
          the global business arena. Of course, a freight forwarder like GAJ can
          shoulder a lot of the complexity of clearing goods through customs and
          spare you from micromanaging the customs clearance process yourself.
          However, everything will seem less complicated if you choose GAJ for
          your service.
